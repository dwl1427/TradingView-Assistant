# TradingView-Assistant
TradingView Assistant is a Desktop Application designed to help users automate their strategies. To make this application simple, you need to write your strategy in PineScript and apply it to TradingView. And then you need to create a Webhook on that strategy. After that, you can open this application and automate your own strategy.
